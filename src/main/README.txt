In charge of: Sprites/loading sprites to board
Contribution: I have implemented the Assets and sprites for the game which required the development
of the sprite sheet and cropping them then incorporating each into the board,
i've also made the methods to reset the board values and the class to print out the walls,
players, monsters onto the game client gui. It would also update each sprite on the board depending on the
frames per second. I've also attempted creating a user input field to connect the client to the server
when you join the IP address.

Name: Ben Osullivan StudentId:s3662617
In charge of: server
Contribution: I have implemented the whole server code which enables players to join the game
and the client specifically MonsterGame,MonsterHandler and State.
I have also implemented the interfaces for the monster game and server and also the
the monster game enums. Since the server requires the board class to run, i have made the BoardPiece class
for the other team members to use when they want to add an something to the grid and have coded most
of the board class as well.

I have also created the base of the project and initialised all possible test cases for team members
to work with.
